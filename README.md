# Elevator
This project is an implementation of an elevator control program in Java. It consists of the Elevator class, which contains methods for moving the elevator up and down, as well as for moving to a specific floor. 

In the Main class, the Elevator class object is initialized and the user enters the floor number through the console, after which the Elevator class move method is called to move the elevator to the specified floor. 

The code also provides for error handling when entering an invalid floor.
